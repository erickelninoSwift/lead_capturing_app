# lead_capturing_app

leads-capturing application { CRUD on a Leads module.} HTTP verbs in use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE and Create a front-end for capturing leads using the endpoints created

Part 1:

1. Create some (authenticated) endpoints using Node and Express.

2. These endpoints should be for CRUD on a Leads module. Just basic contact details will be enough.

3. Leads should be stored in a database, Mongo or Postgres

4. I would like to see the following HTTP verbs in use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE

Part 2:

1. Create a front-end for capturing leads using the endpoints created in part 1

2. Create a report that allows us to display all leads captured on a given day or for a range of days.
